# Insight-Data-Engineering-Coding-Challenge

## Required Packages
```
import sys
import csv
from collections import Counter
```

## Run Instructions
To run the script, type`sh run.sh`in terminal </br>


## Approach
1. I create a dictionary called `record_dict` with unique keys, product and year pairs. </br>

2. Then I create a method to add companies to this dictionary based on product and year. </br>

3. I input the complaints.csv and generate a record_dict for future usage. </br>

4. I do the calculations based on the instruction to generate output. </br>

5. Finally, I turn the output into the report.csv </br>

## Final Words
Thank you for the opportunity and I really enjoyed this coding process. And please let me know where I can improve my code.
